"""
💪 This exercise is HARD 💪
Take a look inside file1.txt and file2.txt. They each contain a bunch of numbers, each number on a new line.
You are going to create a list called result which contains the numbers that are common in both files.

e.g. if file1.txt contained:
1
2
3

and file2.txt contained:
2
3
4
result = [2, 3]

IMPORTANT:  The output should be a list of integers and not strings!
Try to use List Comprehension instead of a Loop.
