# Prime Number Checker
# Prime numbers are numbers that can only be cleanly divided by themselves and 1. Wikipedia
# You need to write a function called is_prime() that checks whether
# if the number passed into it is a prime number or not.  It should return True or False.
# 7 is a primer number because it is only divisible by 1 and itself.
# But 4 is not a prime number because you can divide it by 1, 2 or
# NOTE: 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by 1 and itself,
# but 1 is not a prime number because it is only divisible by 1.

# Example Input 1
# 73

# Example Output 1
# True

# Example Input 2
# 75

# Example Output 2
# False
